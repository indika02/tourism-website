                <h3>Veasak Poya</h3>
                <p>Observed and celebrated by Buddhists, this important religious and cultural festival begins on the full moon of the lunar month of Vesak, which is May on the Gregorian calendar. This week-long celebration, known as the Festival of Light,

                    and drinks to passers-by and spend the days in their local temple practising religious activities such as praying and fasting. Amid the festivities, the highlight is the colourful lanterns and lights outside ever Buddhist home, temple
                    and shop, it truly is a mesmerising sight. If in Sri Lanka in May, Vesak Poya is a wonderful and vibrant festival for visitors to experience, however the sale of alcohol and fresh meat is usually prohibited during the week period.

                <h3>Katharagama Festival</h3>
                <p>Held in the remote southern town of Kataragama, one of the holiest places on the island, this festival is of significant religious importance in Sri Lanka. Celebrated as the same time as Kandy’s Esala Perahera, Kataragama’s version may
                    not be as famous, but it is still on the same grandeur and vibrant scale. Although the festivities at Kataragama during July or August are predominantly celebrated by Hindus, other groups from major Sri Lankan faiths such as Muslims
                    and Veddas also attend. The pilgrims are there to fulfil their vows and seek divine guidance from Lord Kataragama and often indulge in rituals such as acts of self-mutilation such as skin piercing. As the festivities begin, locals
                    and visitors can enjoy the energy and excitement of elephant parades, musicians, dancers, fire eaters and jugglers and acrobats who all perform to the rhythm of the chants and drums.

                <h3>Nallur Festivel</h3>
                <p>Running for 25 days, the enormous and spectacular Nallur Festival held in Jaffna rivals the grand celebrations of those at the Kandy Esala Perahera. The remarkable Kandaswamy Temple becomes the focus of the festival where thousands of
                    followers congregate. Men dress in white sarongs, and women wear their best saris which transforms the temple complex into a sea of vibrant colours. Throughout Nallur there are many parades featuring juggernaut floats, performers and
                    glistening thrones being carried around town. The 24th day of Nallur marks the Ther festivities whereby a huge chariot is pulled by hundreds of sarong-clad men and becomes the biggest night of the holiday. The following day, entranced
                    devotees display self-mutilation by driving skewers through their bodies and make their way to the temple to the beat of drums and stopping periodically to dance. The enthusiasts who perform these self-mortifications believe that god
                    will protect them from any pain.

                <h3>Thaipongal</h3>
                <p>Thai Pongal has been celebrated for over 1,000 years and is one of the most cherished of Tamil holidays. It starts on the first day of Thai on the traditional Tamil calendar, which usually falls in mid-January, and marks the start of the
                    sun’s six-month journey northbound. This important harvest festival focuses on honouring the sun god ‘Surya’ as well as cattle, both which play an integral role in bringing a good harvest. Traditionally in India the festival runs over
                    four days, however Sri Lankan’s tend to keep the festivities limited to two days. During the first day of Thai Pongal, families decorate their homes with banana leaves and colourful kolam patterns made with rice flour and boil rice
                    in milk along with spices, nuts and raisins to share with locals. On the second day, the cattle that help farmers in their rice fields are honoured by being bathed, painted with coloured dyes and given beautiful garlands that hang
                    around their neck and horns.

                <p>The Sinhala and Tamil New Year takes place at the beginning of the Lunar year, typically April, where the whole island comes alive with colourful festivities and a vibrant spirit. In the run up to the New Year celebrations, Sri Lankans
                    will prepare by cleaning and decorating their houses, making traditional sweets and desserts and spending time with loved ones. During the actual day, locals will adorn their best outfits and take part in numerous activities such as
                    blessing their children with herbal oils, sharing the first home-cooked feast of the year with family, setting off fireworks and playing games in the street. Sri Lankan New Year is an exciting time to be visiting the teardrop island,
