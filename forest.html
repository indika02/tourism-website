                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/Horton-Plains.jpg">
                <h3>Horton Plains</h3>
                <p>At an altitude of 2,100 meters above sea level, the Horton Plains extends over more than 3,169 hectares of the highest plateau of the island.The great plains of the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka was discovered by the planter Thomas Farr
                    in the early 19th century. The Horton plains was discovered by planter Thomas Farr in the beginning of the 19th century. These great plain named Horton plains (1834) as a honor of governor of Ceylon Sir Wilmot Horton. The visitor center
                    is significant in the sense it has become the starting point for the 9 km main hike from the Horton Plains. The main trek taking a circular route can be enjoyed within 3 hours. The path opens with an extensive view of the flora: naked
                    meadow patina here; Densely wooded cloud forest out there. Once the meadows have passed, the trek leads for about 2 km through a thin stretch of cloud forest. Cultivated in the forest among nellu shrubs and keena trees are spices grown
                    in nature: pepper, cinnamon and cardamom.
                    <br> Horton Plains can be reached by any of these all roads. - Via Nuwara Eliya, Ambewela and Pattipola (32 Km) - Via Haputhale or Welimada, Boralanda, Ohiya (38Km) - Nwara Eliya, Hakgala, Rendapola, Ambewela, Pattipola (38Km) If you

                    is often obscured by the fog, especially during the rainy season from April to September. The early morning (between 6am and 10am) is the best time to visit, before the clouds roll in. This is when you spy on the toy town tea plantation
                    villages in the valley below, and a unhindered view towards the south towards the coast. In the evening and early in the morning, you will need long pants and a sweater, but the plains warm up quickly, so grab a hat for sunscreen.

                    been banished to the highlands and the attempt by his betrothed to join.

                    As all the passes were guarded the young man let down a rope of twisted creepers over the escarpment, as she was hauled up she was dashed against the rocks and died. The Gods, moved to pity by the harrowing spectacle, caused a stream of water to gush
                    from the mountain and veil all evidence of the tragedy in a watery light, hence the term Diyaluma.

                <h3>Doovili Ella</h3>
                <p>Many secrets and wonders of nature lie hidden within the Sinharaja Forest Reserve. One such wonder is the Duvilli Ella; a beautiful waterfall discovered quite recently. Although its height has not yet been determined, it is estimated to
                    be over 500 feet high. The flow rate of the waterfall is constant all year through, and the spray creates a misty halo around the area. The name ‘Duvilli’ means ‘fine dust’ –therefore we can assume that the natives compared the water
                    spray to a dusty look and hence the waterfall was named Duvilli Ella.
                    </br>
                    There are many indigenous plant and animal species to be found in this unspoiled environment surrounding the waterfall. It has retained its natural habitat due to its location, which is not easily accessible by motor vehicles. A number of smaller waterfalls,
                    about 50 to 60 feet high, can be spotted on the path to Duvilli Ella, urging you on towards the vision of beauty ahead.

                    It will also provide opportunities for eco-tourism and economic development in this area and to model dry zone landscape improvement. In the longer term, within the first 3-5 years, the garden will feature those plants that are lesser known and under
                    utilized in the dry zone promote the herbal industry; and provide education and training on botany and floriculture in the dry zone
                    </br>
                    This garden being established in a dry landscape would provide much relief and peace of mind to the visitors

                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/ridiyagama.jpg">
                <h3>Ridiyagama Safari Park</h3>
                <p>Ridiyagama Safari Park was established on 28th May 2016 in the Ridiyagama area in Ambalantota, Hambantota District in the Southern Province. Construction of the park commenced in 2008 under the guidance of the National Department of Zoology,
                    Sri Lanka. The estimated cost of the safari park and project, built for tourism, is 1.6 billion Sri Lankan rupees.
                    </br>
                    The specialty of this place is that when the animals are free, people go to see them in a caged car. You can reach this park by going about 17 km from Ambalantota town on Ridiyagama road or by turning off at Padalangala junction on Embilipitiya Nonagama
                    road and going on Suriyawewa road and turning at Viharagala junction for about 4 km.
                    </br>
                    About 500 acres of land has been set aside for this park and it is proposed to set up 13 zones for different species of animals. At present work has been completed on three animal zones of about 200 acres. These animal zones are the African Lion Zone,
                    which covers an area of about 35 acres, the Herbivore Zone, which covers about 80 acres, and the 54 – acre Asian Elephant Zone. Work is currently underway on four more zones for Bengali tigers, Australian kangaroos, Sri Lankan leopards,
                    and bears. At present, about 200 animals belonging to 22 species. The park is equipped with air-conditioned safety buses carrying about 20 visitors at a time and safety vehicles of your choice.
                    </br>
                    The first to be found here is the African Lion Zone. Then meet the herbivorous animal zone. There you will find spotted deer, deer as well as zebras, camels, dwarf hippopotamuses, Arabian oryx, guanaco, blackbuck, and ostrich that are not found in the
                    common forests of Sri Lanka. Finally enters the region of Asian elephants. It takes about an hour and a half to visit all these regions. Along the way, a guiding safari officer informs the tourists about the animals that live in each
                    of these areas. Also, Ridiyagama is the only safari park in Sri Lanka that has been created according to such a new concept. Therefore, this is a safari park that attracts local and foreign tourists.</p>

                <h3>Udawalawa Elephant sanctuary</h3>
                <p>Embark on a thrilling wildlife safari in Udawalawe National Park and be prepared for an adventure of a lifetime. Known to be the best place to spot Sri Lanka’s most treasured giants, the Sri Lankan Elephant, the Udawalawe National Park
                    promises to explore a plethora of other species to admire too! However, a visit to the Udawalawe Elephant Sanctuary is one of the most fulfilling trips to make during your adventures on the island.
                    </br>
                    Located in Udawalawe, the Elephant Sanctuary acts as a rehabilitation and transit home for baby elephants that have been injured, sick or orphaned from around the island. The animals are then looked after and nursed back to health until they are deemed
                    fit enough for release back into the rugged jungles. The ethical sanctuary allows its residents to roam freely around the premises and does not constrict them to chains or cages. The best time to visit is during a weekday, as weekends
                    and public holidays crowds of visitors. While you’re not allowed to interact with the elephant, visitors are permitted entry to the sanctuary during elephant feeding times when the calves are fed milk every 3 hours starting from 9am
                    to 6pm.
