            <h3>Sri Dalada Maligawa(Temple of the Tooth Relic)</h3>
            <p>After the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva.</br>The Sacred Tooth Relic, which
                is the Buddha’s left canine was brought here during the reign of king Kithsiri Meghavanna (301-328 B.C.) by Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala from the Kingdom of Kalinga, India.</br>The temple is open from dawn to dusk. It houses a tooth
                relic of the Lord Buddha, and is consequently considered one of Sri Lanka's most holy shrines.Although you may not view the actual tooth itself, the casket within which it is said to be is displayed twice a day. The best time to view this
                ornate casket is around 6.30PM Make sure to cover up below the knees with pants and everything on the shoulders.........</br>

                    for free behind it so don't feel like you need to give a donation as you have already had to pay 1,000 LKR. Foreigner entrance: LKR1,000. The Pooja times are 6.30 AM, 9.30 AM and 6.30 PM. There are two sides to this – some prefer to

                    <p>DambakolaPatunaViharaya- A temple built in reminiscence of a great arrival.
                        </br>
                        Built in the third century BC in memory of the arrival of the Bo sapling from the Sri Maha Bodhi of India in the hands of none other than ArahantSangamitta, the daughter of Emperor Asoka of India, DambkolaPatuna Sangamitta Viharaya stood by an ancient
                        port in the north of Jaffna which was used during the pre- Christian times.
                        </br>
                        The temple then known as the Samudrasanna Viharaya was built commemorating the arrival of the Bo sapling by King DevanampriyaTissaandwas housed one of the first eight shots of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, which was planted on the same place where the original
                        tree was kept beforebeing conveyed to Royal Gardens, the Mahamewuna of Anuradhapura.
                        </br>
                        The arrival of the Bo sapling, ArhantSangamitta and artisans of eighteen varieties to attend every need of the Bodhi Tree saw a cultural upheaval in Sri Lanka resulting in greater advancements in agriculture, irrigation, arts, literature, sculptor, architecture
                        and town planning, engineering, medicine and many other.
                        </br>
                        Due to the great social, religious and cultural importance of ArhantSangamitta’s arrival SamudrasannaViharaya was considered an important land mark in ancient Buddhist culture in Lanka. Yet with the fall of Anuradhapura Kingdom and Mahavihara the legend
                        surrounding the temple and port were soon forgotten. After losing it glory with time and loss of importance of the JambukolaPattana port to Mahatitta in Mannar the temple was rebuilt in 11 th century AC by King Vijayabahu the first.
                        <br> The Old chronicles of Lanka,Mahavamsa records pilgrims as far as West Asia, then known as ‘Yonakapura’ arriving in Sri Lanka as pilgrims to Samudrasannaviharaya as late as 12 th Century
                        <br> However the few remains of the old temple and the old Bo tree has long ceased to exist today and the temple found on the location is new structure built by the Sri Lankan Navy. Yet the newly built stupa stands tall amidst
                        the Palmyra groves and the young Bo tree as a memory of a of a Port, which welcomed the golden era to Lanka and of a Bikkhuni turned Princess, who brought one of the greatest gifts from India to Sri Lanka.</p>

                    <p>Built in the second century BC by King Saddatissa enshrining the relics of Lord Buddha, Deegawapiya is one of the sixteen most sacred pilgrim locations of Lanka.Believed to have received sanctity by Lord Buddha himself when he visited
                        Sri Lanka for the third time accompanied with 500 arhants, Deegawapiya had been first made in to a temple by the father of King Saddatissa, King Kwantissa nearly fifty years before the stupa was built.
                        </br>
                        The stupa had received royal sponsorship until the country was colonized by the Portuguese and nearly 400 years of colonization saw the ruin of the stupa and the monastery. The stupa was rediscovered in 1916 yet the war and the activities of the villagers
                        around had destroyed the stupa and the ancient constructions around. However the site is being renovated and excavated by the Archeological Department at the moment.

                        </br>
                        In the second century, there was a growing sea-level situation (possibly the first recorded tsunami in Sri Lanka) in Kelaniya. People thought this was due to the sin committed by King Kelanithissa in order to kill a monk.To change this sin, he was asked
                        to sacrifice his daughter, the princes Vihara Maha Devi by putting her down.

                    <img src="images/adams-peak.jpg">
                    <h3>Sri Pada(Adam's Peak)</h3>
                    <p>The mountain is located in the southern reaches of the Central Highlands, in the Ratnapura District and Nuwara Eliya district of the Sabaragamuwa Province and Central Province —lying about 40 km northeast of the city of Ratnapura and
                        32 km southwest of the city of Hatton. The surrounding region is largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain is a wildlife reserve, housing many species and endemic species.
                        Most local people believe dwarf elephants (kuru ali) live in this samanala forest.
                        </br>
                        Adam's Peak is important as a watershed. The districts to the south and the east of Adam's Peak yield precious stones—emeralds, rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and which earned for its ancient name of Ratnadvipa.
                        </br>
                        The peak pilgrimage season is in April, and the goal is to be on top of the mountain at sunrise, when the distinctive shape of the mountain casts a triangular shadow on the surrounding plain and can be seen to move quickly downward as the sun rises.
                        </br>
                        Climbing at night can be a remarkable experience, with the lights of the path leading up and into the stars overhead. There are rest stops along the way.
                        </br>
                        The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it is hard to climb the mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick mist.
                        </br>
                        For Buddhists, the footprint mark is the left foot of the Buddha, left behind when Buddha visited Sri Lanka, as a symbol for worship at the invitation of Buddhist God Saman.
                        </br>
                        Access to the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte & Malimboda. The Nallathanni & Palabaddala routes are most favored by those undertaking the climb, while the Kuruwita-Erathna
                        trail is used less often; these trails are linked to major cities or town by bus, accounting for their popular use.
                        </br>
                        The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte & Malimboda routes are hardly used, but do intersect with the Palabaddala road midway through the ascent.
                        </br>
                        The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent via Hatton and descent via Ratnapura; although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of the other trails by approximately five kilometers.
                        </br>
                        Sri pada season begin in December and it is end in May. The January to March period is particularly busy time to climb.
                        </br>
                        Most people starting this journey Dalhousie call nallathanni. nallathanni is 3 hours from hatton.</p>

                        for long time. Being a major place for Hindu pilgrimage, it was labelled "Rome of the Gentiles/Pagans of the Orient" in some records. Koneswaram gains its name from the main deity of the temple, the Hindu God Shiva. Konesvaram
                        played a main role in the religious and cultural history of Sri Lanka which was probably built during the reign of the early Cholas and the Five Dravidians of the Early Pandyan Kingdom. Developed from 205 BC. J.-C., the original
                        kovil combined key features to form its basic Dravidian temple plan. A 17th century stone inscription in the temple indicates that the temple began its history in 1580 BC. Today the temple is one of the important religious buildings

                    <h3>Muhudu Maha Viharaya</h3>
                    <p>Built nearly 2000 years ago to celebrate the landing of Queen Vihara Maha Devi, the wife of King Kawantissa, the ruler of Rohana and the mother of King Dutugamunu, the hero of Mahavansa Chronicle, Muhudu Maha Viharaya or the Temple
                        by the Sea’ is just a stone throw away from the Pothuvil Town.
                        </br>
                        Although the archeological evidence holds the temple to have been built in the fifth century AC by King Mahanama, the legend holds that the temple also known as the Samudra Maha Vihara, is to be the place wherethe storm tossed Princess Devi landed in
                        the Ruhuna Kingdom. According to a stone inscription that was found in the vicinity of the shrine, it had also been called the Ruhunu Maha Viharaya in the days gone by.
                        </br>
                        The historical facts are heavily clouded with myths and legends. The story based on the arrival of Princess Devi claims that she was first spotted at a village near Pottuvil but when the king arrived at the spot the craft carrying the princess had drifted
                        to the ocean and the disappointed king questioned the villagers 'Ko Kumari?' which eventually gave the village its name 'Komari'. Later the princess had touched land at Arugam Bay and the villagers told King Kawantissa that the
                        princess had landed at 'Ara Gama' which later changed into 'Arugam'.
                        </br>
                        The temple site which is under the heavy threat of encroachment by villagers has been reduced to a small shrine with three granite statues. The central statue is of the Buddha with two more sculptures believed to be those of royalty facing it. Believed
                        to have been built in the 5th century A.D during the reign of King Dhathusena, many believe the royal figures depicted in worshiping position are to be those of King Kavantissa and his Queen Vihara Maha Devi.
                        </br>
                        The great stretch of beach behind the temple is yet to be excavated and is believe to hold many hidden artifacts swept under the sands of times.

                        tutelary divine of Kelaniya continues to present itself.
                        </br>
                        The annals, Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, record in detail the tale of the Buddha's visit to Kelaniya on the eighth year after his Enlightenment. The jeweled throne, on which the Buddha sat while preaching, is said to have been enshrined in the stupa at the
                        Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya.
                        </br>
                        The temple is also famous for its image of the reclining Gautama Buddha and paintings by the native artist Solias Mendis which depict important events in the life of the Buddha, in the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, also incidents from the Jataka tales.
                        It is the venue for the Duruthu Maha Perehera procession each January. An 18-foot stone statue of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has been erected at the temple.
